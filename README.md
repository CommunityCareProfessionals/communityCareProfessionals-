# Community Care Professionals

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  Your superheroes don't always have to be on the big screens or come to you through a streaming service. With our Community Care Professionals (CCPro) app, that hero may be someone next door, or better yet, the one you see in the mirror. With this app, we are uniting the world through Care and offering everyone the opportunity to bless or be blessed -- all pro bono. This app runs purely as a web application and requires no installation on your device. Yes! This is our little way of bringing Care to you and people all over. Why don't you subscribe and do the same.

### Consumer-dashboard

A service consumer sees all active service request, but also the opportunity to create new ones. Without you creating those service requests, there can be no heroes.
